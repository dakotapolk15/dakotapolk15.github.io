        The artifact that is created is a recode form java to c# where it is completely rewritten code. The main thing of the code is to be able to create a game where you can choose what team is in what game and choose what players are on what team. The reason for choosing the ePortfolio is to show the ability to change from one code type to the other and have it function like the other code type. It shows the ability to rewrite code to a different code language. While working on modifying the artifact is a lesson taking time and taking breaks helps with going back to it to see at a different angle that can help improve it more. The challenges that were face figure out the way to convert form java to c# and having it work properly without trying to run into too many errors.
