            This enchantment is a recode of travlr program which is in JavaScript that got converted to c# where is supposed to show a webpage that as multiple tabs that function and show information. The process of converting this code from one code type to the other had some issue while figuring the right way to right the code into c# while I did run into many errors at first with converting it over the errors was fixable and lead to functional code
